    <p>The <strong>coin flip</strong> is much more than a simple game of chance. It's a universal ritual, a quick decision-making tool, and a cultural symbol that has stood the test of time. From refereeing a football match to resolving a dilemma between friends, flipping a coin is a gesture we all know. But what really lies behind this ancient practice?

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold my-4">A History with a Sharp Edge</h2>
    <p>The origin of Heads or Tails dates back to Ancient Rome, where the game was called "navia aut caput" (ship or head), referring to the motifs engraved on the coins of the time. Roman emperors used it to make decisions, believing the outcome was a sign from the gods. This practice has continued through the centuries, becoming a simple and recognized way to ensure an impartial decision.</p>
    
    <p>Today, the coin flip is embedded in our culture:</p>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside my-4 pl-4 space-y-2">
        <li><strong>In sports:</strong> To decide which team starts the game.</li>
        <li><strong>In pop culture:</strong> The character Two-Face in Batman makes it his trademark for his macabre decisions.</li>
        <li><strong>In daily decision-making:</strong> "Heads, I'll have pizza; tails, sushi."</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold my-4">How Does Our Coin Flip Simulator Work?</h2>
    <p>In a digital world, there's no need to dig through your pockets for a coin. Our online tool is designed to be simple, fast, and fair.</p>
    <ol class="list-decimal list-inside my-4 pl-4 space-y-2">
        <li><strong>One Click is All It Takes:</strong> Click the "Flip the coin!" button to start the realistic 3D animation.</li>
        <li><strong>Guaranteed Randomness:</strong> Our simulator uses a pseudorandom number generator (PRNG) algorithm. In concrete terms, with each flip, the computer chooses a random number. If the number is even, the result is "Heads"; if it's odd, it's "Tails". This ensures a strict 50/50 probability, every time.</li>
        <li><strong>A History for Statisticians:</strong> The tool keeps track of the number of "Heads" and "Tails" outcomes, as well as the total number of flips. Ideal for those who love statistics or for settling long-term scores!</li>
    </ol>

    <p>A coin flip can be much more than just a decision-making tool. Here are some creative ideas to incorporate it into your daily life:</p>

        <li><strong>Gamify Chores:</strong> Heads, you take out the trash. Tails, I do.</li>
        <li><strong>Productivity Aid:</strong> Can't decide between two tasks? Heads, I'll start with task A. Tails, task B. This helps break procrastination.</li>

    </ul>
